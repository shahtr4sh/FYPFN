Introduction:
Hi everyone! 👋 Thanks for helping with my Final Year Project.

What we are doing: I am studying 'Information Propagation Speed'—basically, how fast students process notifications in a group chat setting compared to other platforms.

The Rules:

1. I will post a piece of news/update shortly.

2. Please read it as if you just received it from a friend.

3. Immediately answer the 2 Polls I send right after.

4. IMPORTANT: Please be 100% honest. If you would usually ignore it, say you’d ignore it. If you’d freak out and share it, admit it! There are no wrong answers.

Stand by! 🚀
